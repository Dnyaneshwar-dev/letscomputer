<h1>What is Data Science?</h1>
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining.

Data Science is a field where we apply ‘science’ to available ‘data’ in order to get the ‘patterns’ or ‘insights’ which can help a business to optimize operations or improvise decisions.
Every business has data but its business value depends on how much they know about the data they have.
Data Science has gained importance in recent times because it can help businesses to increase business value of its available data which in turn can help them to take competitive advantage against their competitors.
It can help us to know our customers better, it can help us to optimize our processes, it can help us to take better decisions. Because of data science, data has become strategic asset.
