Cyber security is the state or process of protecting and recovering networks, devices and programs from any type of cyberattack.
Cyberattacks are an evolving danger to organizations, employees and consumers. They may be designed to access or destroy sensitive data or extort money. They can, in effect, destroy businesses and damage your financial and personal lives — especially if you’re the victim of identity theft.
What’s the best defense? A strong cyber security system has multiple layers of protection spread across computers, devices, networks and programs. But a strong cyber security system doesn’t rely solely on cyber defense technology; it also relies on people making smart cyber defense choices.

The good news? You don’t need to be a cyber security specialist to understand and practice good cyber defense tactics. This guide can help. You’ll learn more about cyber security and how to help defend yourself against cyber threats, and how to recognize and avoid threats before they infiltrate your network or devices.

Cyber security vs. computer security vs. IT security
As mentioned above, cyber security is the practice of defending your electronic systems, networks, computers, mobile devices, programs and data from malicious digital attacks. Cybercriminals can deploy a variety of attacks against individual victims or businesses that can include accessing, changing or deleting sensitive data; extorting payment; or interfering with business processes.

How is cyber security achieved? Through an infrastructure that’s divided into three key components: IT security, cyber security, and computer security.

Information technology (IT) security, also known as electronic information security, is the protection of data both where it is stored and while moving through a network. While cyber security only protects digital data, IT security protects both digital and physical data from intruders.
Cyber security is a subset of IT security. While IT security protects both physical and digital data, cyber security protects the digital data on your networks, computers and devices from unauthorized access, attack and destruction.
Network security, or computer security, is a subset of cyber security. This type of security uses hardware and software to protect any data that’s sent through your computer and other devices to the network. Network security serves to protect the IT infrastructure and guard against information being intercepted and changed or stolen by cybercriminals.
Types of cyber security
In order to be better protected, it’s important to know the different types of cybersecurity. These include critical infrastructure security, network security, application security, information security, cloud security, data loss prevention, and end-user education.
<ul>Types of Cyber  SEcurity
<li>
Critical infrastructure security: Consists of cyber-physical systems such as electricity grid and water purification systems.</li>

<li>
	Network security: Protects internal networks from intruders by securing infrastructure. Examples of network security include the implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA) and new, strong passwords.
</li>
<li>
Application security: Uses software and hardware to defend against external threats that may present themselves in an application’s development stage. Examples of application security include antivirus programs, firewalls and encryption.
</li>
<li>
Information security: Also known as InfoSec, protects both physical and digital data—essentially data in any form—from unauthorized access, use, change, disclosure, deletion, or other forms of malintent.
</li>
<li>
Cloud security: A software-based tool that protects and monitors your data in the cloud, to help eliminate the risks associated with on-premises attacks.
</li>
<li>
Data loss prevention: Consists of developing policies and processes for handling and preventing the loss of data, and developing recovery policies in the event of a cyber security breach. This includes setting network permissions and policies for data storage.
</li>
<li>
End-user education: Acknowledges that cyber security systems are only as strong as their potentially weakest links: the people that are using them. End-user education involves teaching users to follow best practices like not clicking on unknown links or downloading suspicious attachments in emails—which could let in malware and other forms of malicious software.
