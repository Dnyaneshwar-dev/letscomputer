A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.
<br><br><br>



Databases have evolved dramatically since their inception in the early 1960s. Navigational databases such as the hierarchical database (which relied on a tree-like model and allowed only a one-to-many relationship), and the network database (a more flexible model that allowed multiple relationships), were the original systems used to store and manipulate data. Although simple, these early systems were inflexible. In the 1980s, relational databases became popular, followed by object-oriented databases in the 1990s. More recently, NoSQL databases came about as a response to the growth of the internet and the need for faster speed and processing of unstructured data. Today, cloud databases and self-driving databases are breaking new ground when it comes to how data is collected, stored, managed, and utilized.

<ul><h1>Types of Databases<h1>
<p>
There are many different types of databases. The best database for a specific organization depends on how the organization intends to use the data.
</p><br>
<li>
<h2>Relational databases:</h2><br> Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. Items in a relational database are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. Relational database technology provides the most efficient and flexible way to access structured information.</li>
<li>
<h2>Object-oriented databases :</h2> Information in an object-oriented database is represented in the form of objects, as in object-oriented programming.
Distributed databases. A distributed database consists of two or more files located in different sites. The database may be stored on multiple computers, located in the same physical location, or scattered over different networks.
Data warehouses. A central repository for data, a data warehouse is a type of database specifically designed for fast query and analysis.</li>
<li>
<h2>NoSQL databases : </h2>
 A NoSQL, or nonrelational database, allows unstructured and semistructured data to be stored and manipulated (in contrast to a relational database, which defines how all data inserted into the database must be composed). NoSQL databases grew popular as web applications became more common and more complex.
</li>
<li>
<h2>Graph databases : </h2>
A graph database stores data in terms of entities and the relationships between entities.</li>
<li>

<h2>OLTP databases : </h2> An OLTP database is a speedy, analytic database designed for large numbers of transactions performed by multiple users.
